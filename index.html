You’re slowly becoming the sweetest <br>
part of my everyday life...🍯💕<br>
Even on my busiest days,<br> 
I still think of you at least once,💭<br>
and always with a smile...😄<br><br>

Wanna know what my favorite moment is?<br>
It’s when you read me little poems and<br>
stories...🎀Those quiet moments bring me<br>
so much peace and happiness...🥰<br><br>

Promise me you’ll keep reading to me<br>
forever?💌Even when we’re old <br>
and a little wrinkly? 📖👵🏻🧓🏻<br><br>

I always listen to EDM while I worked💻🎧,<br>
But since you shared “Dear Emily”,<br>
it’s become my favorite...🎶<br>
Now I always play it while I work...<br>
and even when I can’t sleep...😊<br><br>

My “Good Morning” and “Good Night” messages? <br>
They're my quiet way of saying,<br>
“I miss you.”...💗<br><br>

No matter what kind of day you’re having<br>
good, bad, or in between... <br>
you can always talk to me...<br>
I’ll be here... Always...💖<br><br>

Wishing you a beautiful year ahead!🌼<br>
May this birthday bring you <br>
calm mornings, warm sunsets,<br>
and the quiet joy that stays<br>
with you always...😊<br><br>

And one more wish from my heart: 💬<br>
I hope we’ll travel together<br> 
to many places, near and far...<br>
and collect memories that are just ours... ✈️🌍💑<br><br>
I’m a little shy to say all this face to face...🙈😄 <br>
But I hope this message says<br>
what my heart’s been trying to...💛<br>
Happy Birthday again, my (...) one...💕<br>
