You’re slowly becoming the sweetest part of my everyday life.🍯💕<br>
Even on my busiest days, I still think of you💭<br>
at least once, and always with a smile...😄<br><br>

Wanna know what my favorite moment is?😬<br>
It’s when you read me little poems and stories...🎀<br>
Those quiet moments bring me so much peace and happiness...🥰<br><br>

Promise me you’ll keep reading to me forever?💌<br>
Even when we’re old and a little wrinkly? 📖👵🏻🧓🏻<br><br>

I always listen to EDM while I worked💻🎧,<br>
But since you shared “Dear Emily”,it’s become my favorite...🎶<br>
Now I always play it while I work… and even when I can’t sleep...😊<br><br>

Those “Good Morning” and “Good Night” texts I send?✨🌙<br>
They're my quiet way of saying, “I miss you.”...💗<br><br>

No matter what kind of day you’re having good, bad, or in between <br>
you can always talk to me.I’ll be here... Always...💖<br><br>

Wishing you a beautiful year ahead!🌼<br>
May this birthday bring you calm mornings, warm sunsets,<br>
and the quiet joy that stays with you always...😊<br><br>

And one more wish from my heart: 💬<br>
I hope we’ll travel together to many places, near and far...<br>
and collect memories that are just ours... ✈️🌍💑<br><br>
I’m a little shy to say all this face to face...🙈😄 <br>
But I hope this message says what my heart’s been trying to...💛<br>
Happy Birthday again, my (...) one...💕<br>
